X      #14 Error in average wait time -5
X      #15 Error in no. of cars that crossed intersection -3
X      #16 Error in no. of trucks that crossed intersection -3

All files produce correct number of cars/trucks compared to sample outputs
Only input2.txt produces a wait time error


X   Other errors (specify):
	Traffic Light change not mentioned: -10

"Please notice in the sample output, WHY the traffic light changed is displayed. This is another debugging tool to help."
No mention that it is required in OUR output files.  Also not specified in rubric, so it was not a specific criteria
Why a whole letter grade?
